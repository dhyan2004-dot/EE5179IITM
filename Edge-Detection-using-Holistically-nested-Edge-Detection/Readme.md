# Depth-Map Generation of SPAD images by HED type inception-net formulation

A streamlined version of the Inception architecture designed for efficiency and high performance in Kaggle competition environments.

### Highlights
- **Custom Blocks:** Uses "Inception-Lite" modules to capture multi-scale features without the heavy parameter cost of standard InceptionV3.
- **Kaggle Integration:** Includes code for processing competition datasets and generating `submission.csv` files.
- **Efficiency:** Optimized for environments with limited GPU memory.
