# VGG-11 Image Classification (CIFAR-10)

This project implements the **VGG-11** architecture from scratch using PyTorch to solve the CIFAR-10 classification challenge.

### Key Features
- **Architecture:** 8 Convolutional layers followed by 3 Fully Connected layers.
- **Data Pipeline:** Includes automated downloading of CIFAR-10, normalization, and data augmentation.
- **Optimization:** Uses Cross-Entropy Loss and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum.



### How to use
Simply run the notebook. It will partition the data into training, validation, and test sets and output the final accuracy and loss curves.
